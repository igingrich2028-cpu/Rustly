# **App Name**: Rustly

## Core Features:

- Code Editor: An integrated editor with syntax highlighting for Rust code, allowing users to write and modify their programs.
- Compile and Run: Functionality to send user-written Rust code to a backend compiler (like an embedded `rustc`) for compilation and execution, returning the results.
- Output Display: Dedicated panels to display compilation errors, warnings, and the program's standard output, clearly indicating the execution status.
- Example Snippets: Pre-loaded basic Rust code examples to help new users get started quickly and demonstrate core language features.
- AI Error Explainer: An AI-powered tool that analyzes compiler errors and provides simplified, natural language explanations and potential fixes.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A professional and vibrant blue-violet (#477FEB) for interactive elements and emphasis, symbolizing clarity and precision in a coding environment.
- Background color: A dark, desaturated blue-gray (#1F242E) that reduces eye strain and provides a focused workspace, reflecting a powerful tool for developers.
- Accent color: A soft, inviting cyan (#85D2E0) that provides an additional layer of hierarchy and guides user attention, harmonious with the primary and background tones.
- Headlines and UI text: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for its modern, clear, and objective aesthetic, ensuring high readability for interface elements.
- Code display: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for optimal readability and differentiation of code within the editor and output panels.
- Use minimalist, outline-style icons to maintain a clean and professional look consistent with developer tools, enhancing functionality without visual clutter.
- A clean, functional split-panel layout, typically with the code editor on one side and the output/controls on the other, designed for efficient use of screen space and minimal distractions.
- Subtle and purposeful animations, such as smooth transitions for panel resizing or a concise loading indicator during compilation, providing immediate user feedback without being 'over the top'.
